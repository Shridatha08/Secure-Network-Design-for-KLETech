# Secure-Network-Design-for-KLETech

A Campus network is an important part of campus life and network security is essential for a campus. Campus network faces challenges to address core issues of security which are governed by network architecture. Secured network protects an institution from security attacks associated with network. A university network has a number of uses, such as teaching, learning, research, management, e-library, result publishing and connection with the external users. Network security will prevent the university network from different types of threats and attacks.

In this project, a tested and secure network design is proposed based on the practical requirements and this proposed network infrastructure is realizable with adaptable infrastructure.
